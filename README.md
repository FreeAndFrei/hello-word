# hello-word

## self introduction

Yes, hello if someone is looking at this. I'm ***Forever*** and since I'm not new to opensource I first start to learn to use Github recently.

### what I'd like to do

I'm really a suporter of opensource. And I'll be glad to help others by their projects in my **freetime**.        I'm preparing for the finall exam in junior high school, so maybe I'm not online all the time. You can contact me over **E-mail**.
